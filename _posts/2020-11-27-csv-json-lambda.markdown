Welcome back to my blog,

Recently I was tasked to convert a csv file to json in Lambda from AWS.

I haven't used this technology in many years and I was very pleasantly surprised with the improvements made to the UI and overall experience.
I used TypeScript to write the code and compiled it into JavaScript so I could use it as a native nodeJS Lambda function.

Have a look at my GitHub project page to see the code: [Lambda CSV to JSON Parser](https://github.com/jdksloan/LambdaCSVParser).

Yours Truly,

The Silent Coder.
