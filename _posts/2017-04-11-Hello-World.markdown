Welcome to The Silent Coder.

Hello World, for the most part, is the default application learned when starting a new programming language. Based on this idea Iâ€™ve decided that it is a most fitting title for the first post of this website.
I created this website as a foundation to discuss design, development and everything IT. AngularJS, ReactJS, C#, and JavaScript  are just a few of the development topics that will be discussed.
I am an IT enthusiast so will also include all the latest and greatest tech topics.

I will also be posting the music that I listen to while coding, as I feel this is an integral part of design and development.

IT is the future and we are the the artisans.

Yours Truly,

The Silent Coder.
