Welcome back to my blog,

Mathematics was one of my favourite subjects in school, so I thought I'd explore some of the more interesting problems and concepts.

Code is great at brining concepts to actual runnable algorithms, so the concepts can be experimented with easily. I decided to use TypeScript and NodeJs to create a Maths Sandbox.

Have a look at my GitHub project page to see the code: [Marvelous Mathematics](https://github.com/jdksloan/marvelous-mathematics).

Yours Truly,

The Silent Coder.
