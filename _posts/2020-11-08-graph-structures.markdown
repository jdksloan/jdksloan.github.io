Graph data structures have existed in mathematics for centuries, and naturally that would progress into computer science. Mathematics is what peaked my interest in the subject.

A graph is made up of vertices, also called nodes, which are connected by edges, also called links or relationships and used to model pairwise relationships between objects.
A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically.

Having looked around the open source community, I noticed the lack of TypeScript libraries to implement this data structure, and decided to make my own. I really enjoyed this challenge.

Have a look at my GitHub project page to see the code: [Graph data structures](https://github.com/jdksloan/ts-graph-structure).

Or install it using [npm i ts-graph-structure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-graph-structure)
